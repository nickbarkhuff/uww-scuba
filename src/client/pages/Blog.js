                        Having a blog on your website will accomplish a few different things:
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb1">
                        <strong>Make your site (and business) appear active.</strong> Setting up a new website without regularly adding and updating content means that no one will have a reason to visit more than once. You want people coming back regularly to see if there's anything new; if there is, it means they're spending more time on the site, which means they're more likely to do business with you. It also gives your brand the image of being well-maintained. Again, because SCUBA is a dangerous sport, you need to convince potential customers that they can trust you, and having a stale website with outdated information doesn't help.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb1">
                        <strong>Improve search engine ratings.</strong> Have you ever tried to look up a recipe or something equally inane on Google, but when you clicked on it, you had to scroll through someones life story before getting what you were actually looking for? That's because the content on a website is what Google (and other search engines) uses to determine how it should rank them. The more words on your site are related to what someone searched for, the higher up on the page they will be displayed. So, if you have a bunch of SCUBA-related blog posts on your website, it is more likely to come up when someone searches, for example, "scuba classes tigard". And, of course, more clicks means more business.

                        <strong>Gives you somewhere to promote products on the site, while also showcasing your experience.</strong> Say you get a new product in stock: the Super Dive Computer 3000. A few of your staff members take it on some dives to try it out. They write about what they did and didn't like about it, and send their thoughts to me. I take that info and turn it into a blog post: "Is the Super Dive Computer 3000 right for you?". That gets displayed on the home page in the "What's new?" section.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb1">
                        Now, people who are visiting the site will both see that you have this new dive computer in stock, and they won't have to leave the site to get more information about it. They can read the post for expert opinions on the product, to help them decide if they want to buy it. If they have more questions, they can fill out the contact form or go to your store.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb1">
                        This isn't only about helping sell your products directly, though: it's about showcasing your skill. You have a team full of divers with many years of experience between them; by putting that on your website, people will get a taste of what they could get if they do business with you. They won't just see you as a dive shop, they'll see you as a team of highly skilled experts with years of knowledge to share. <em>Your professional opinion is the most valuable thing you have to offer.</em>
