                        The only thing I would change about your current staff page is that the images should all be of the same format. You should have all of your staff memebers that you want on the site take a headshot in front of a white backdrop. Having an image of someone in full scuba gear makes it hard to make out who they are. You can include these kinds of images if you want, but they shouldn't be the primary image that gets displayed.
