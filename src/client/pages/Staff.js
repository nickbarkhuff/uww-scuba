                        I like that the staff images on your site are all taken against the same backdrop; the consistency makes it look more polished and thought-out. They are a bit low-res though, and retaking them against a white background would go well with this site's design. Putting a human face on your business is a great way to build trust, so having a few people on the home page is a good idea.
