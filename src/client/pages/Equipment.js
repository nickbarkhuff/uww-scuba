                        Your equipment related services can be broken down into four parts: buying, renting, maintenance, and tank fills. Since these probably make up a large portion of your bottom line, having a page where users can easily browse everything you offer is going to be the best bang-for-your-buck improvement. This is even more important because of covid: no one wants to go into a brick-and-mortar store unless they are sure they will get something out of it. If a user can look on your website and see that you carry a particular product, or can do a particular service, they'll be much more likely to actually come in, vs. going to another dive shop.

                        Ideally, you would have your entire inventory on here, complete with up-to-date information and at least one high-quality image of each product. This will take a lot of time, but creating this catalog is one of the services I can offer you, if you choose to hire me as your developer and marketing expert.
