                        Every activity that you run should be displayed in one place, so that customers can see at a glace what is happening in the world of Pacific Watersports. For classes, you should list only the first day, instead of having every classroom or pool session; someone who is interested in taking classes will only care about when they are starting. If they want more details, they can click on the class to get more info.

                        I see that you have a schedule page on your website, which is great! But navigating a page of only text can be difficult; with a new layout, the information on your site will be much more accessible to potential customers.
