                        Every activity that you run should be displayed in one place, so that customers can see at a glace what is happening in the world of UWW. For classes, you should list only the first day, instead of having every classroom or pool session; someone who is interested in taking classes will only care about when they are starting. If they want more details, they can click on the class to get more info.

                        I see that you have a schedule page on your website, but there is no content on it! This is very bad from the perspective of a user; it makes your site (and, by extension, your business as a whole) look abandoned and dead. By contrast, having a site that is constantly being updated with new information and content will give your brand an image of professionalism.

                        This is what I can do for your business. Having a great looking website is only half the story; without someone to keep it updated and create new content, potential customers are less likely to view your brand as trustworthy. And being trustworthy is especially important for a sport that is so potentially dangerous.
